# Rush Hour
Rush Hour is a slide puzzle game in which a red car has to exit the board. This is not so easy, however, as the red car is blocked by multiple cars and trucks! The game's rules are simple - vehicles can only move in the direction of their orientation, are not allowed to turn, and cannot drive to spots where other vehicles are located - but finding the best solution to the puzzle is incredibly difficult, especially as the size of the gameboard increases!

Therefore, our team set out to develop a good algorithm for a computer to find a fast and short solution to rush hour puzzles.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
This codebase is written in Python 3.8.10. No additional packages are required to run the code. 

### Structure 
Alle Python scripts staan in de folder Code. In de map Data zitten alle input waardes en in de map resultaten worden alle resultaten opgeslagen door de code.
- /code: contains all code for this project
-- /code/algorithms: contains all algorithms
--- /code/algorithms/breadh_first.py


### Test
Om de code te draaien met de standaardconfiguratie (bv. brute-force en voorbeeld.csv) gebruik de instructie:

```bash
python main.py
```
